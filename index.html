                        Bonjour! I'm a passionate, eager to learn but most importantly fun guy trying to make some cool games! 
                        My main goals are to bring a smile to those that play my games, and making sure everyone in my team during the creation of the game is also smiling!
                        I can work on my own, but I also really like and am capable of working in teams!   
                        I'm very passionate about VR and everything related, and my end goal is to help creating some innovative games for VR.
