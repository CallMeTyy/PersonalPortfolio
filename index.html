                    <img src="images/Polliword.png" class="left">
                    <p>Polliword is a Physics Puzzle based game where you play as a Frog. You can use your tongue to collect words, which can alter the world. Use these words to finish puzzles, and platform your way to the end!</p>
                    
                    <p>This game was made as a team effort. As the only engineer I did all the coding. All the physics were made from scratch, only the engine basics (object hierarchy and rotation/position alteration) was done using the existing code.</p>

                                Vector Arcade is a small game made as a proof of concept of a small physics engine built within the .NET environment. The game consists of two minigames: A bullet hell game and a small platformer. This game was made entirely by myself.

                        Bonjour! I'm a passionate, eager to learn but most importantly fun guy trying to make some cool games! 
                        My main goals are to bring a smile to those that play my games, and making sure everyone in my team during the creation of the game is also smiling!
                        I can work on my own, but I also really like and am capable of working in teams!   
                        I'm very passionate about VR and everything related, and my end goal is to help creating some innovative games for VR.
