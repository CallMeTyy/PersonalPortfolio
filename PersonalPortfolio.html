                    <img src="images/Sand.png" class="right">
                    <p>I created a sand shader that allows for different texture inputs, controllable height and controllable track generation (meaning you can give it different kinds of ways to actually make dents like footsteps or wheel tracks).</p>
                    
                    <p>It was fully made by me in the Unity Game engine on the Built-In shader pipeline. It currently has a verysimple character controller, that creates footsteps based on speed and walking direction.</p>

                    <img src="images/Nature.png" class="left">
                    <p>I created a simple dynamic nature scene with several shaders to create a small world. It uses volumetric lighting to create lightrays with a water shader, grass shader and dynamically moving clouds. </p>
                    
                    <p>The scene itself uses assets from the Unity Asset store. All shader coding, scene layout and lighting was done by me.</p>

                        Bonjour! I'm a passionate, eager to learn but most importantly fun guy trying to make some cool games! 
                        My main goals are to bring a smile to those that play my games, and making sure everyone in my team during the creation of the game is also smiling!
                        I can work on my own, but I also really like and am capable of working in teams!   
                        I'm very passionate about VR and everything related, and my end goal is to help creating some innovative games for VR.
