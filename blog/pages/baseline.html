                        <p class="my-3">I wanted to give a brief overview of my knowledge of Unreal Engine before starting the project, jsut so I can compare it all at the end.
                            So far I have about a year of experience with Unreal. I started learning the engine during my internship, and used it a lot during that half first half year.
                            I learned the basics from most aspects and got to delve deep into the VR Expansion Plugin, a plugin we will also be using for this project.
                            <br>I mainly got to work with widgets and statically moved components combined with wires, as my focus was making machines. I have not yet done much with animation, which will be a large focus of this project.
                            I have done some work with materials, but I don't know much about the details and wish to learn more about that too.
                            Finally, I have yet to use many C++ classes. Any for that matter. I aim to learn much in that regard, as my knowledge is limited in that field.
