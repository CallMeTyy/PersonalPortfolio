                        <p class="my-3">Hi! Welcome to my blog :) This is the first post on the website where I will give a quick explanation on the current state of the project. I won't go too much in depth on details, and I will be keeping everything informal. I might miss a couple of things as well, as this was made by myself and not in collaboration with the others of my team. I am planning to keep the blog in terms of style a bit light and informal, meaning not much thought to heavy words and mainly just writing my thoughts and actions. I want to do this to make everything as pure as possible as if I would be talking and explaining my work in person! Thanks for reading!</p> 
                        <p class="my-3">We are currently in week 3 of the project and everything has been going pretty well so far. We started out with brainstorming for possible concepts and decided to do something different for this project. Last year we had contact with HTC and we had contact about them being our client during IMT&S, but sadly during the holidays that idea was shut down. Now we have the whole semester to come up with new ideas and make something that we can proudly show to publishers, while trying to also contact publishers in order to possibly get in touch during development.</p>
                        <p class="my-3">Our current idea is to make a Puzzle-Adventure game, set in a universe where space travel is normal. We want to create a game where players can use their creativity to solve simple puzzles, with many different possible ways to solve the problem (think Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom or Human Fall Flat). In order to prepare to the future and for us to be able to achieve our learning outcomes we want to make the game a co-op experience, meaning everything is ready for an Apollo Arena type game (will explain down below if you've never heard of Apollo Arena) in the future.</p>
                        <p class="my-3">So the past few weeks I and the other engineer (Maurits Dijkman) have been working hard on creating prototypes. So far I have completed a simple version of the Bow and started working on implementing a full body inverse kinematics rig. Expect blog posts on both soon. We started the project with the VR Expansion Plugin, which makes life a whole lot easier. I will go into details on the plugin on the post "What do I know? A baseline" which I will write after this. I am also busy helping others learn unreal, as at present time I have the most experience with the program out of the peple in our group. I am having some problems with the IK rig (inverse kinematics), but I hope to solve those soon. There is little documentation, and even less tutorials on the matter so it will be a project of trial and error. My favorite! :) I hope to get some results soon, but so far I have a lot to write on research which is a good thing for the blog I suppose. But yeah! It's been fun :)</p>
                        <p class="my-3 font-weight-bold">Apollo Arena</p> 
                        <p class="my-3">So as promised before I will give a quick explanation on what Apollo Arena, our previous project, was and why we decided to do something else.</p>
                        <img src="../../images/ApolloArena.png" alt="" class="w-75">
                        <p class="my-3">Apollo Arena is a VR multiplayer bow shooting game where players fight in an Arena to get the most kills. It uses the free-for-all format (no teams, everyone just fights eachother and whoever gets the most kills and least deaths wins), with future game modes planned. It was the end result of the second year project and we proudly presented our work at WirWar and got in contact with multiple publishers on the game. The game was made in Unity and was made for PCVR (meaning you could not run it stand alone on the quest). We had a lot of fun creating it and wanted to continue working on it for IMT&S, and as we had good contact with HTC and a possible partnership we were allowed to work on it for the project.</p>
                        <p class="my-3">However, as stated before, HTC said that they would not take on the project during the holidays. This means that at the time of writing we have no client, and we have full freedom on what we want to do with the project.</p>
                        <p class="my-3">As stated before we also had contact with other publishers, they sadly said no, but they did give us some useful insights. The main problem with Apollo Arena was the fact that it was a multiplayer only game. This means that it needs multiple people online at all times in order for new players to have fun. This is risky for experimental games, as there were no real games to compare it to. This combined with the school-project (rushed) state Apollo Arena was in we decided it was the best idea to start a fresh project, which allowed the move to Unreal Engine.</p>
                        <p class="my-3">With the start of a new project and no real client there was nothing stopping us from altering the game to make it more attractive for publishers. And after discussing possibilities we really all just wanted to make a game from scratch, with some of the aspects from Apollo Arena kept. We thus landed on the Puzzle Adventure game we are planning on making, with the Story Line and gameplay features still in the works. I am excited to work on the project and am curious to see how it will turn out!</p>
